# relay-notify.sh — opt-in cross-agent handoff notification via the relay store.
#
# Sourced by companion scripts (codex/cursor). relay_notify writes a REDACTED
# handoff signal to HARNESS_RELAY_TO when HARNESS_SESSION_RELAY is both|turn.
# This is the cross-agent (CC↔Codex/Cursor) handoff path: companion delegations
# become relay signals a peer CC session can observe via session-relay-watch.sh.
# Default OFF.
#
# Redaction is structural: relay_notify takes only <backend> <subcommand>
# <write> — it has NO prompt parameter, so the companion's prompt body (which
# may contain secrets) can never be forwarded to the relay store.
#
# Usage (sourced): relay_notify <backend> <subcommand> <write>
